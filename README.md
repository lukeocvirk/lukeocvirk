Hi, I’m Luke Ocvirk, a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Guelph with a passion for the theory and practice of software development, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

I have spent several months working at IBM’s AI Lab on watsonx Orchestrate, building real-world solutions for some of IBM’s most important clients.

I am deeply interested in learning new things and am always happy to chat about new discoveries, technologies, and opportunities!
